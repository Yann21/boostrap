# Boostrap environment

## TODO
Some environment like work computers should have everything installed while
others like AWS servers should only have essential utilities like vim and
command line programs but not Emacs for example.

## Prerequisites
`sudo apt install rcm yarnpkg cmake golang npm curl inotify-tools`

## Start
```
git clone https://github.com/Yann21/system.git
./install.sh
```

## Finishing touches
`sudo apt install fzf conda fasd bat python3-venv libnotify-bin`
